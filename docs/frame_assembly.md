# Lay out the frame and label the extrusions

Lay out your extrusions like this and add a label to each. We'll be referring to these by their label througout the build process.

To help visualize where these go in the printer, you can refer to this image to see where they go

# Prep the rails 

In this step, you will prepare the linear rails for use. Some vendors are providing rails which do _not_ need to be prepared prior to use, if you have one of these then skip this step.

**Parts needed:**
* All 5 linear rails

**Steps:**
1. Clean out any shipping grease with Isopropyl alchohol and any other gentle degreaser.
2. Using a NGLI2 rated grease such as Mobilux EP2, pack the rail bearings with grease and ensure that the rails move smoothly. Refer to [Nero3d - Lubrication Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYvhYjkBFTY&list=PL7zrGeKp_8CTDOmpwZr5JnCSJqEghFh9j&index=38) for a more in-depth explanation.

5. Add one M3x8 BHCS to each end of each extrusion, leaving a 2mm gap 
6. Attach the extrusions to the frame, making sure that the preloaded nuts are on the top and _outside_ faces of the extrusions, and that the extrusion with 2 nuts on the bottom is in the rear of the frame. 
7. Ensure that the top of the extrusions is level and square with the rest of the frame.

**Steps:**
1. Loosen the screws holding the Y axis extrusions to the frame
2. Insert the Y axis spacers between the top extrusion and the Y axis extrusion
3. Adjust height of the Y axis extrusion so that the extrusion is parallel to the top and the spacer parts fit snugly
4. Tighten the screws to lock the Y axis extrusion in place 
5. Remove the Y axis spacers and repeat for the other side


# Frame complete!

It's recommended to watch this video on ensuring squareness of the frame, and make sure that your frame is as square as possible. This makes assembly easier and reduces troubleshooting issues later with print quality.
